Hi all,  
On November, 19th, I will give a talk (in French) about how Rigging is used to help Animation.  
With my friends from [RGBa][2], we are going to speak about how to set up a 3D shot from scratch.

If you don't worry about French, you can find all information on [Capitole du Libre website][1]  
(and more talks on french version of this post).
